# Encrypted-File-Transfer
Project that allows file transfer between C++ based client and Python based server which use encryption to communicate securely.
This was created as a final project for the course "Defensive System-Programming".
# Usual protocol flow

# Technical specification
WIP
# Implementation details
Client uses the CryptoPP library for encryption while the server uses PyCryptodome
Actual file transfer uses AES-CBC with 128 bit key while key exchange uses RSA-1024
Client uses boost for all connection related functionality
Server uses a Selector to handle connections - file transfer is chunked to minimize client starvation
